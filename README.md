## Term 1 Portfolio Project


# Ivan Donato - Portfolio


This is my portfolio website written in HTML and CSS for our Term 1 Assessment at Coder Academy. 

I enjoyed designing and executing the website and am hopeful that it displays not only my relevant skills in HTML and CSS, but also provide a glimpse into my personality as well.

## Motivation & Inspiration
As an aspiring developer, this was a great opportunity to be able to demonstrate my knowledge base so far. I've found the course to be incredibly rewarding to this point in time and was very excited to be able to once again put my recently acquired skills to the test.

As much as my motivation would be focused primarily to attract and interest for any future employers, I also sought out to define a design philosophy from the beginning and stick to it as closely as possible until the end. I wanted to do this in order to see out my initial design and not be swayed to include many wonderful things that I may have seen my classmates implement. I wanted to be disciplined and stick to my guns. It would also provide me with a clear understanding on where I might need to improve.

## Design Process
I'm a very visual person by nature. Perhaps it may be because of my background in the Performing Arts, but I am also predisposed to "do" before I "plan". This may seem like I frequently throw caution to the wind or fly by the seat of my pants, but this line of thinking is present in all great art forms. I figured that as I had learnt a decent amount of HTML and CSS theory in the previous week(was it only that long?) and I felt relatively comfortable during that time, I felt that I had a significant structure beneath me in order to improvise my design initially. Essentially, I wanted to jazz.

As stated on my portfolio website, I'm incredibly interested in narrative particularly when it comes to user experience. With this in mind, I wanted each individual section to tell it's own unique story. What became clear to me was that I needed to make my website as dynamic as possible. I found a javascript library which is led by CSS called 'Animate on Scroll'

I knew from the beginning that I wanted to make my website single-page-scroll. It seemde like the natural thing to do
